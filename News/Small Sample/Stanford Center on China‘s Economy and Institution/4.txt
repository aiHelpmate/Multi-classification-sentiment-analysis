The international community has long recognized China's effort to produce
enough food to feed its growing population. Tremendous progress has been achieved
in agricultural productivity growth, farmer's income, and poverty alleviation during the
reform period. China's experience demonstrates the importance of institutional
change, technological development, price and market liberalization, and rural
development in improving food security and agricultural productivity in a nation with
limited land and other natural resources.
While we are interested in farm-sector productivity and rural incomes, in general,
most of this article focuses on a narrower set of issues, especially the role of
technology in China's food economy. Rural development in China is a complicated
process and will require good policies beyond the way the government must manage
agriculture technology. Issues of land management, fiscal and financial policy, and
many other issues are equally as important. In fact, in a recent conference on land
tenure in Beijing, D. Gale Johnson convincingly argued that land reform is critical in
promoting economic modernization of both the rural farm and non-farm sectors. We
agree. Unfortunately, space limitations preclude us from giving more emphasis to
these issues in this paper.
