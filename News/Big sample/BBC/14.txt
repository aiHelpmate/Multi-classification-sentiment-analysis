Beijing's announcement on raising its poverty line has been praised by newspapers across China.
A rural resident with a yearly net income of less than 2,300 yuan ($361) will now be considered living in poverty, report the People's Daily and China Daily.
This is a rise of 81% from the 2010 standard. But most newspapers chose to compare it with 2009's figure, making it a rise of 92%.
As the new policy was unveiled, President Hu Jintao told an anti-property convention in Beijing that the government was striving to provide adequate food and clothing for poverty-stricken people and ensuring their access to compulsory education, basic medical services and housing by 2020.
An editorial on the Beijing News praised the move for respecting reality and answering calls from society.
