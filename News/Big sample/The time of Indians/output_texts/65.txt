KOLKATA: â€œWest Bengal was the only state that had managed to bring down the number of people living below the poverty line by half, in the last 10 years,â€� stated Pradipto Ghosh, additional secretary in the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office, on Friday. Ghosh, who met members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce during the day, said the National Human Development Report also showed that Indiaâ€™s rate of poverty had come down to 26.10 per cent in 1999-2000 from 44.48 per cent in 1983.â€œBihar and Orissa remained the problem areas though,â€� he added. The Centre also had a plan for those selling goods on the pavements or pulling rickshaws, he said. â€œWe are contemplating policy reforms so as to create a fee-based regulation for them instead of one based on fiat. This will allow them to stay away from trouble with the authorities and also help them get loans from banks and other institutions,â€� Ghosh said. ICC members though seemed apprehensive about the governmentâ€™s efforts to expedite economic development. Concerned about the high import tariff and how it affected the manufacturing industries, they warned that if India stuck to the growth rate of five per cent, then Chinaâ€™s economy would be six times that of Indiaâ€™s by 2010. â€œChina has witnessed a fall in birth rate. With lesser children to bring up, savings are more. Savings in India are around 23 per cent while in China is 35 per cent. This allows lower rates of interest. India might also achieve 35 per cent savings in the next 15 years,â€� explained Ghosh. Ghosh stressed the need for public-private partnership. â€œOur goal will be to carry resources from the private sector to the services for which the government is responsible. The policy will be to outsource as many jobs as possible,â€� he added. The power sector, claimed Ghosh, was one of the most difficult areas of reforms. The total subsidy in power accorded to states was Rs 39,000 crore. â€œThere is a proposal where states will be allowed to settle 60 per cent of their dues in one go and purchase tax-free bonds with the rest,â€� he said.
