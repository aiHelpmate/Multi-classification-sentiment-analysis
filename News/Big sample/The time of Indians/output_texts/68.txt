No country in human history, has ever taken 700 million people out of poverty in 30 years as China has done," he said while delivering a speech at the CPC's Central Party School during his visit to Beijing. China and Pakistan view each other as 'all-weather' allies and Beijing is Pakistan's major source of defence equipment. China has also agreed to provide financial aid to cash-strapped Pakistan government to tide over the current financial problem.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.
