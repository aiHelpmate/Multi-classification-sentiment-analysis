NEW YORK: French president Emmanuel Macron has called for forging new alliances by including “big players” China and India to break out of “vicious cycles” and produce results in the fields of climate change, gender equality, health and education to eliminate extreme poverty.“We need to gather the big players, we need to get China and India to have much bigger results … We agree to disagree on many topics, but let’s go as much as we can on these issues.I want to open topic by topic,” Macron told the Goalkeepers meet organised by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation here on Wednesday. Bill Gates said the two big waves in development in the recent past were driven by China and India, and the experiences hold lessons for sub-Saharan Africa which should be the world’s next focus to pull people out of extreme poverty.Congratulating India for focussing on sanitation through Swachh Bharat mission, Gates said India should move towards toilets that burn the waste.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.
