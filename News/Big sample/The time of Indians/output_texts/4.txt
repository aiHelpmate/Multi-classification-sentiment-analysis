AURANGABAD/PATNA: BJP president Amit Shah on Friday slammed Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and other Grand Alliance leaders for seeking proof of recent surgical and air strikes carried out by the Indian forces in Pakistani territory.Addressing an election rally at Aurangabad to garner support for party candidate Sushil Kumar Singh, Shah said it was unfortunate that the opposition parties have even started doubting the usefulness of anti-satellite missile, which India successfully tested on Wednesday to join the big league of the USA, Russia and China.“The GA cannot ensure national security. They cannot do any good either to the country or Bihar. They have neither a leader nor policies,” Shah said.The BJP chief said people should ensure Narendra Modi’s return to power as he is the only leader capable of freeing the country from poverty and strengthening its defence power.Since Aurangabad, also known as Chittorgarh of Bihar, is a Rajput-dominated constituency, Shah did not forget to play the upper caste card. “The Modi government did what the Congress government could not do despite ruling the country for several decades. It gave 10% reservation to the upper castes in government jobs and educational institutions,” he said.Shah said Lalu era gave Bihar jungle raj and fodder scam. “If you vote for the GA, you will be voting for return of jungle raj,” Shah said, adding PM Modi gave Bihar Rs 6.06 lakh crore against Rs 1.93 lakh given by Congress-led UPA government in 10 years.Shah also mocked Congress for playing the role of a junior partner in Bihar GA and settling for just nine seats offered by the RJD. State BJP president Nityanand Rai, party’s national general secretary Bhupender Yadav, JD(U)’s Karakat nominee Mahabali Singh and BJP leader Hari Manjhi from Gaya also attended the rally.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.
