NEW DELHI: Pakistan and China on Tuesday refuted a report in a UK daily that the former is rethinking its role in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it was "unfair", reported newspaper Dawn.The article was carried by The Financial Times (FT) on Monday and was titled: "Pakistan rethinks its role in Xi's Belt and Road plan". It quoted a key adviser to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan as saying that CPEC "unfairly benefits Chinese companies," and adding that Pakistan must "put everything on hold for a year so we can get our act together".A statement issued by Pakistan's commerce ministry said the Pakistan government "rejects the article especially the title." Radio Pakistan, the country's official broadcaster, also reported a government issued statement saying Pakistan and China will continue to work towards implementing ongoing CPEC projects and expand the initiative to new areas of cooperation."The statements attributed to adviser to the Prime Minister on commerce and textile have been taken out of context and distorted," the commerce ministry statement said, and it reiterated that CPEC is a "national priority for the government."The statement from the Chinese embassy called the FT article "ill-intentioned" and "based on distorted and misquoted information."There was a "firm consensus between China and Pakistan that CPEC is a mutually beneficial project and both governments will carry it forward according to the needs of Pakistan", said China through its embassy in Islamabad.And far from putting anything on hold, Radio Pakistan said that there are even new areas that the two governments would work on, including "socio-economic development, poverty alleviation, anti-corruption, agricultural cooperation and industrial development." It said this resolve to expand the Pak-China partnership was reached during China's foreign minister's recent three-day visit to Pakistan.However, Abdul Razak Dawood, Prime Minister Imran Khan's adviser on commerce, textile, industry & production and investment was quoted as saying quite the opposite to The Financial Times. "The previous government did a bad job negotiating with China on CPEC - they didn't do their homework correctly and didn't negotiate correctly so they gave away a lot," said Dawood.The Chinese are unfairly going to benefit more than Pakistan, said Dawood further."Chinese companies received tax breaks, many breaks and have an undue advantage in Pakistan; this is one of the things we're looking at because it's not fair that Pakistan companies should be disadvantaged," Dawood's quoted as saying.He went further."I think we should put everything on hold for a year so we can get our act together...Perhaps we can stretch CPEC out over another five years or so," Dawood is quoted as saying.His statements echoed PM Khan's statements from before he became PM. At the time, Khan, didn't always have good things to say about the CPEC project. He'd been mostly worried about what he thinks is the lack of transparency and the possibility of widespread corruption at CPEC's myriad projects. After becoming PM, it appeared Khan softened his tone on CPEC.In an interview with a Chinese daily a few days before the country's general elections in July, he said "the corridor project has brought about many positive changes to multiple areas of Pakistan's economy", reported Pakistan's Daily Times, quoting Khan's interview with Chinese language newspaper Guangming Daily."The changes prove that the corridor has a positive effect on the development of Pakistan. I believe that the corridor construction in the medium and long term will be firmly guaranteed and will continue to be implemented," Khan said to the Chinese newspaper.Interestingly, Chinese state-backed media said in July that it sees the new Pakistani government continuing to promote CPEC, despite Western media "hyping Imran Khan's reservations about the project". China's Gobal Times also warned Khan that Western media which will "try to drive a wedge" between Beijing and Islamabad."It's also foreseeable in the future that Western countries and media will continue to make an issue of the corridor and Chinese investment in Pakistan in an attempt to drive a wedge between China and Pakistan. The new Pakistani government should be particularly wise to this," said the article in the media outlet run by People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's Communist Party.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.
