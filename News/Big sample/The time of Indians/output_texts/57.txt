PERINTHALMANNA: Attributing the Left Front government''s success in West Bengal to land reforms, Chief Minister Buddhadev Bhattacharya on Saturday called on his counterparts in other states and people in the country to launch a fresh initiative to alleviate poverty."It is regrettable that a majority of the population in the country is still reeling under poverty.Our efforts should be towards redressing their problems", he said, inaugurating a cooperative hospital here, named after veteran Communist leader, the late E M S Namboodiripad."It is a difficult situation in the country, that even 57 years after Independence, a good number of people are living below the poverty line, with no access to education", he said.Noting that it was the foremost duty of every elected government to alleviate poverty, Bhattarcharya said his government was formulating programmes to extend education to all sections, including those living in rural areas."Kerala is a success story in our country that has registered cent per cent literacy", he said, adding that Noble Laureate Amartya Sen had recently told him Kerala was moving in the right direction and could be compared to any province in China.Stating that 72 per cent of land in West Bengal belonged to poor and marginal farmers, he said the government had been repeatedly voted back to power in the last six assembly polls.
