new delhi: unimpressed by the steps taken in pakistan to combat terrorism, india has termed them ''inadequate'' and dismissed chinese calls for restraint, saying these should be directed to pakistan. in a terse response to china's remarks calling for restraint, the external affairs spokesperson said: ''our view is that the calls for restraint should be directed to pakistan.it is pakistan which needs to take action â€” whether on restraint, terrorism or reduction of tensions.'' the retort, the second in last three days in response to chinese statements, is an indication of india's unhappiness with china's recent stance. india had earlier this week rejected china's categorisation of kashmir as ''the core issue between india and pakistan''. asked about the government's response to the steps taken by pakistan against terrorist organisations and their leaders, the external affairs spokesperson said the steps were ''not adequate. there is still much more that needs to be done. we have to drive a stake through the heart of terrorism. they haven't done that yet''. there were indications that pakistan would come under pressure from member countries during the forthcoming saarc summit with some countries planning to propose a saarc extradition treaty. the fact that pakistan has not enacted domestic legislation against terrorism in keeping with the 1993 saarc convention on suppression of terrorism is also likely to provide an opportunity to criticise pakistan for its record on terrorism. terrorism, poverty alleviation and economic integration are likely to be on the agenda of the forthcoming summit.
