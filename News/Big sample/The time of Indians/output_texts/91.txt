CHENNAI: CPI state secretary R Mutharasan issued a statement on Thursday welcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping to Chennai and urged partymen to participate in large numbers to welcome the visiting dignitary.The DMK, the AIADMK and many smaller parties in both the Dravidian alliances have welcomed the Chinese President. The CPM, however, has been maintaining a stoic silence on the Mamallapuram summit.CPM sources told TOI that they have not changed their views on China though the party’s national general secretary Sitaram Yechury met Jinping during his previous visit to India. Noting that China had grown to face the might of the US, Mutharasan said India needed to maintain good relations with the neighbour. He suggested that the two neighbours adopt a new economic policy, which would benefit both the nations. “China’s population is more than that of India. We need to learn a lot from China to alleviate poverty and fight unemployment and hunger,” said Mutharasan. India got closer to other nations because it was suspicious of Chinese intentions, he said and added that Beijing should allay such fears. “Tamil Nadu CPI welcomes Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping with open hands. Let India-China friendship grow stronger,” said Mutharasan.CPM politburo member G Ramakrishnan said his party welcomed the summit, but would wait for the outcome of the meet before passing comments. “Apart from the two leaders’ meeting, there should be people-to-people relationship. Unlike other parties, we have not released any statement welcoming the Chinese President as we want to see the outcome of the summit,” he said. On September 16, Chinese envoy to India Sun Weidong met Yechury and exchanged views on China-India relations. The envoy also presented the second volume of the book “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China” at the meeting.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.
