# Multi-classification-sentiment-analysis

The project collects online news reports on China's poverty alleviation policies and conducts sentiment analysis. This will give a significant boost to your crawling skills and nlp abilities.

If you want to try a PyTorch-based deep learning project, this is the best choiceÔºÅ

## Data crawling
Crawl the data by searching foreign media that have news reports on China's poverty alleviation policies -- the data and code are saved in the "News" folder

## Data preprocessing
* Drop unwanted colomns.
* Removal of HTML tags, quotations marks, emoticons, and URLs.
* Convert all words to lowcase, remove duplicates.
* Replace concatenated words with their full forms.
* Removal of punctuation, stopwords, numbers and special characters.
* Spellchecker for spelling correction.
